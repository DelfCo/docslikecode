Let's take a look at what docs like code looks like in practice. This video shows you how to clone a GitHub repo with an existing Jekyll theme, and build it locally.

The steps are:

1. Clone a repository that contains a Jekyll theme that you like. We're using the so-simple theme here.
1. Make sure you have all the pre-requisites set up for Ruby and Jekyll.
1. Switch to the cloned git directory.
1. Run `bundle install` to install the required gems.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve the content from a local web server.
1. Copy and paste the `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` URL into your web browser.
