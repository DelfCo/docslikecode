Sphinx, Jekyll, Hugo, all are static site generators that teams use for web sites and documentation sites. Let's go through setting up a static site generator and a common CICD system with it. In this case, we'll dig into Sphinx with Read the Docs, Jekyll with GitHub Pages, and Hugo with Netlify.

In this choose your own adventure series, you first pick the look for the site, then discover the developer language that pairs with the static site generator and then the then the SSG choice follows. We walk through setting up the development environment, and then show how to automate using docs CICD pipelines including Read the Docs, GitHub Pages, and Netlify.

You may also test the docs by with Continuous Integration (CI) systems like TravisCI or CircleCI. If you need to work within existing CI systems, choose a tool that other teams use within your organization, and your choice of output is not limited by the CI system. In other words, the test frameworks in TravisCI or CircleCI do not dictate your deployment system.
Here are three example documentation sites you can write and build using an SSG with CICD.

## Learn Sphinx and GitHub with Read the Docs for Continuous Deployment
