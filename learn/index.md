Sphinx, Jekyll, and Hugo, all are static site generators that teams use for web sites and documentation sites. Let's go through setting up a static site generator and a common CICD system with it.

Let's learn:
* GitHub for documentation sites
* Sphinx with Python

* Hugo with Go
* Working with content in GitHub repositories
* Deployment: Read the Docs, GitHub Pages, and Netlify
* Testing: Travis CI and script examples
* Advanced topics: themes, search, print, versions, and translations
